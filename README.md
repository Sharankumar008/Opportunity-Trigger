# Opportunity-Trigger

Create the object called “Customer Project” and create a Status field under this object with the picklist data type (Values=Active, Inactive). Create the relationship between this custom object and Opportunity so that the Customer Project is a related list to the Opportunity. Create  Active Customer project‑ field on Opportunity object (Data Type=Checkbox)

When we create customer project for an opportunity with status active, then active checkbox should be checked in the opportunity object
